Buffer Overflow Vulnerabilities in Mobile Banking Apps (Native Code Components)
Summary

Buffer overflow vulnerabilities in native code (C/C++) can still affect mobile banking applications. Even when the majority of the app is written in managed languages (Java, Kotlin, Swift), native libraries or SDKs—used for performance, crypto, device features, or third-party components—can introduce memory-safety bugs that allow attackers to corrupt memory, execute arbitrary code, or leak sensitive data.

Scope and Relevance to Mobile Banking

Mobile banking apps handle high-value assets and highly sensitive data (credentials, account numbers, cryptographic keys, transaction tokens). A successful native buffer overflow can allow privilege escalation inside the app process, code injection, or exfiltration of secrets from memory.

Native components are commonly used for:

Cryptographic operations and optimized crypto libraries

Hardware acceleration (camera, biometrics), device drivers, or vendor SDKs

Third-party ad, analytics, or payment SDKs that bundle native .so / .dll components

Cross-platform layers (e.g., game engines, Flutter embeddings, React Native native modules)

Threat Model

Attacker goal: Remote code execution in app process, read sensitive memory, bypass authentication, tamper transactions.
Assumptions: Attacker can control input to a native interface (file, network response, intent payload, URI, user-supplied data, or IPC) or trick app into loading a malicious native library (supply-chain or update compromise).
Constraints: Modern mobile OSes (Android, iOS) apply sandboxing, ASLR, and code signing, but these controls can be bypassed or limited in scope if the overflow achieves a controlled code path, or if a vulnerable library holds secrets in-process.

Typical Vulnerable Patterns

Unbounded memcpy, strcpy, sprintf, gets, or other unsafe C string/memory APIs

Incorrect length checks or integer overflows when computing allocation size

Mixing signed and unsigned types when indexing buffers

Custom parsers of complex formats (images, audio, compressed blobs) implemented in unsafe languages

Example Attack Vectors in Mobile Banking Context

Malicious server response: Crafted asset triggers native parsing overflow in bundled library.

Malicious QR/deep link: Payload passed to native parser without validation.

Malicious file on device/SD card: Local files processed by native code.

Compromised third-party SDK: Vulnerable native library pushed via supply chain.

Detection and Forensic Value

Crash reports: Native crashes (SIGSEGV) referencing native libraries indicate possible overflow.

Memory dumps / heap snapshots: May contain leaked sensitive data like keys or tokens.

Indicators: Repeated crashes in same native module, anomalous processes, unexpected network activity after crash.

Forensic limits: OS protections make full memory analysis difficult, but crash logs, ANR traces, and minidumps are valuable.

Mitigations and Secure Development Practices
Development Time

Prefer memory-safe languages; minimize native code.

Use maintained native libraries and track CVEs.

Avoid unsafe APIs: strcpy, strcat, sprintf, gets.

Enable compiler hardening: stack canaries, FORTIFY_SOURCE, -fstack-protector.

Build with PIE and enable ASLR.

Use AddressSanitizer/UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer in testing.

Validate all inputs before passing to native layers.

Implement secure parsing for complex formats with whitelist and size limits.

Build and CI/CD

Integrate static analysis (clang-tidy, Coverity).

Run fuzzing workflows (libFuzzer, AFL) on native parsers.

Automate CVE scanning for dependencies.

Keep symbolicated crash artifacts securely for debugging.

Runtime / Deployment

Enforce OS protections and code signing.

Limit privileges and isolate sensitive operations.

Use ephemeral in-memory keys, avoid long-lived secrets in native heaps.
